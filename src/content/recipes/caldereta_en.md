This dish is delicious, and perfect for special meals. It can be a bit expensive depending on which seafood you choose, but you can still make it with just cheap, frozen white fish and the sauce will make it amazing.

The best fish for _caldereta_ is **angler**, which has a delicate flavour and pairs extremely well with other seafood. If you buy the whole fish, you can make a _fumet_ with the head and use a bit of it here instead of plain water.

You can also add some potatoes, in chunks, to cook with the fish and make it a fuller meal. But remember that if you add potatoes, you will have to remove them for freezing.

## Ingredients

For 2 portions:

- 250g of angler (other white fish works too), in chunks
- ~12 shrimps (peeled or unpeeled, up to you)
- 250g of clams
- 1 tomato
- ½ onion
- 1 garlic clove
- ~8 raw almonds, peeled
- Fresh parsley
- 2 dried cayenne peppers
- 1 tablespoon of wheat flour
- 200ml of sherry (or other white wine)
- ~200ml of fish stock (or plain water)
- Olive oil
- Salt
- _Optional_
    - 50ml of brandy
    - Tabasco sauce
    - Cuttlefish


## Preparation

At least a few hours before cooking, wash the clams, cover them with water and a generous amount of salt, and keep them in the fridge. This will help to clean any sand leftovers on them.

1. Pour a bit of olive oil in a pan and put it in the stove on medium-high heat. Chop the tomato and the onion in small dice, and add them to the pan. Lower the heat, add some salt, and sauté them to make a _sofrito_.

1. When the _sofrito_ is done, add the flour and stir it for 1 minute so it's cooked. Add the dried cayenne peppers.

1. Pour the wine and the cognac. Then add the fish and the shrimps, and add the fish stock (or water) so the liquid almost covers the whole thing. Turn the heat up so you bring everything to boil.

1. Once it's boiling, lower the heat and let it simmer. Set a timer for 15 minutes.

1. Get the mortar and crush the almonds, the garlic clove and a handful of chopped parsley.  

1. Remove the clams from the salty water and wash them again. Discard those that are open (even if just a bit).

1. Once the 15 minutes are done, add the clams (carefully! you don't want to open one by force) and distribute them evenly in the pan. You want to avoid the clams sitting upon other clams. Add the crushed almonds, garlic and parsley. Add some drops of Tabasco sauce if you like spicy food. Try the liquid and add more salt if necessary.

1. Cover with a lid and let it simmer for another 15 minutes. The fish should be fully cooked, and the clams opened.

1. Discard all the clams that are not opened at this stage.

1. Enjoy and have a meal like a boss.
