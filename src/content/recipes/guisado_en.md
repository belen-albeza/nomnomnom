This recipe is my mom's. This is totally comfort food, and it's healthy!

In theory you should be able to freeze this if you remove the potatoes. Not worth it, in my opinion.

If you don't have sherry, any other white wine works.

About the chicken, it is best if you let it marinate for a few hours in the fridge, but don't sweat it if you forget or you don't have the time.

## Ingredients

For 2 portions:

- 400 g of chicken thighs, skinless and boneless
- 5 mushrooms
- 1 carrot
- 1 small onion
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 tomato
- 2 potatoes
- 200 ml of sherry wine
- 1 chicken stock cube
- 1 bayleaf
- Extra-virgin olive oil
- Spanish paprika
- Black pepper

## Preparation

1. Cut the chicken into small chunks. Remove also the big pieces of fat.

1. Put the chicken to marinate in olive oil, Spanish paprika and black pepper. You don't need to _soak_ the chicken, just spread a bit of that mixture over it, both sides.

1. Prepare a _sofrito_ by slow frying in a tablespoon of olive oil the chopped tomato and onion. When the onion starts to get soft, add the minced garlic clove. While it's cooking, you can chop the carrot and the mushrooms into slices.

1. Once the _sofrito_ is done, put it into a pot. In the same pan, add the chicken and lightly grill it â€“you don't need to add oil since it's marinated with it.

1. Peel the potatoes and cut them into chunks. You should not fully slice them, but make an indent and end the cutting with a twist of the knife. In this way you should get irregular cuts that will release more starch later and make the stew a bit thicker.

1. Put everything into a pot. Pour the sherry and top it up with water. All the ingredients should be covered by liquid. Add the stock cube and the bayleaf.

1. Leave the pot to boil at medium heat. The first five minutes or so without the lid so the alcohol can evaporate. Then cover with a lid so the potatoes take less time to cook. The bigger the chunks, the more time you need. At the very least, it should take about 20 minutes.
