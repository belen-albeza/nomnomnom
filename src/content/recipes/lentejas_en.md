This recipe… well, I made it up from what I thought _**lentejas**_ (lentils) had. And it turned out OK!

Some people like them to be thicker, more like a cream, but I like it more when the lentils are whole and the soup is clear.

Note that _pimentón_ or **Spanish paprika** is _not_ your regular paprika. This one tastes like chorizo, and you can find it outside Spain –well, at least I was able to find it in the UK.

If you don't have **sherry** (I like to use _fino_ ), you can use any other white wine.

I sometimes add a _morcilla_ (blood sausage with onion), though this is optional. Some people add other **meats**, some make this dish vegetarian by removing the chorizo and add potato instead.

## Ingredients

For 2 portions:

- 1 small can (200 g) of cooked lentils
- 1 tomato
- 1 small onion
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 carrot
- 15 cm of chorizo
- 200 ml of sherry wine
- 2-3 tablespoons of Spanish paprika (mild or spicy)
- A pinch of ground cumin
- 1 bayleaf
- Extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt

## Preparation

1. Chop the tomato and the onion into small chunks. Pour 1 tablespoon of oil into a pan and make a _sofrito_ with them (medium-heat). Once the onion starts to get soft, mince the garlic and add it to the sofrito.

1. Once the _sofrito_ is done, put it apart. Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan and cook the chorizo, cut into 1-2cm slices.

1. Put the _sofrito_, the chorizo, the (chopped) carrot and the can of lentils into a pot. Pour the sherry, and add water until everything is covered.

1. Add salt and Spanish paprika to taste, a pinch of ground cumin and the bayleaf.

1. Let it cook –without a lid, so the alcohol evaporates– for some minutes. Since everything is already cooked it won't take long. It's done when it smells amazing.
