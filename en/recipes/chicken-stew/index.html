<p>This recipe is my mom&#39;s. This is totally comfort food, and it&#39;s healthy!</p>
<p>In theory you should be able to freeze this if you remove the potatoes. Not worth it, in my opinion.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have sherry, any other white wine works.</p>
<p>About the chicken, it is best if you let it marinate for a few hours in the fridge, but don&#39;t sweat it if you forget or you don&#39;t have the time.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>For 2 portions:</p>
<ul>
<li>400 g of chicken thighs, skinless and boneless</li>
<li>5 mushrooms</li>
<li>1 carrot</li>
<li>1 small onion</li>
<li>1 garlic clove</li>
<li>1 tomato</li>
<li>2 potatoes</li>
<li>200 ml of sherry wine</li>
<li>1 chicken stock cube</li>
<li>1 bayleaf</li>
<li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>Spanish paprika</li>
<li>Black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Cut the chicken into small chunks. Remove also the big pieces of fat.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Put the chicken to marinate in olive oil, Spanish paprika and black pepper. You don&#39;t need to <em>soak</em> the chicken, just spread a bit of that mixture over it, both sides.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prepare a <em>sofrito</em> by slow frying in a tablespoon of olive oil the chopped tomato and onion. When the onion starts to get soft, add the minced garlic clove. While it&#39;s cooking, you can chop the carrot and the mushrooms into slices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once the <em>sofrito</em> is done, put it into a pot. In the same pan, add the chicken and lightly grill it –you don&#39;t need to add oil since it&#39;s marinated with it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Peel the potatoes and cut them into chunks. You should not fully slice them, but make an indent and end the cutting with a twist of the knife. In this way you should get irregular cuts that will release more starch later and make the stew a bit thicker.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Put everything into a pot. Pour the sherry and top it up with water. All the ingredients should be covered by liquid. Add the stock cube and the bayleaf.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leave the pot to boil at medium heat. The first five minutes or so without the lid so the alcohol can evaporate. Then cover with a lid so the potatoes take less time to cook. The bigger the chunks, the more time you need. At the very least, it should take about 20 minutes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
